Seeing as the majority of the code-base for this phase was carried over from Phase 2, much of the time on Phase 3 was spent modifying existing models to take input from configuration files, creating the House, Bath, and Shower models, as well as configuring and coding the Person model.  This work took the team around 90 hours total from start to finish.

While we did not run into any major difficulties in Phase 3, there were a few aspects of it that required more attention than others.  Coding the Person model proved to be a bit challenging, but writing out the state file beforehand made it easier.  Also, since we were having appliances that need to draw water from the Water heater go through a House object to get the reference to Water Heater, we had to re-work Dishwasher as well as implement this new approach in our Bath and Shower models.  This initially proved difficult as not everyone in the team knew how to implement this behavior right away, but other members of the team lent a hand to help ensure these models worked properly.

Overall Phase 3 went relatively smoothly for our team.  While Trac was effective enough for keeping track of and assigning tasks, some miss-communications between team members about aspects of the project could have been better cleared up by a few in-person meetings.  However this was more a minor inconvenience than a major hurdle, and thus was not too detrimental to our work on this phase.
