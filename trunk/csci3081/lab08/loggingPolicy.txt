Described below are the different logging levels used and a description when
they are used.

DEBUG:
  Used for general debugging purposes, when printing messages about the flow of
  the program or variable values at certain points in the run process.

INFO:
  This is the default level for logging. Messages at the INFO level are
  messages that are required by the program but do not fall into the ERROR
  category and are not part of the debugging.

ERROR:
  Used when an error occurs. Usually the error is properly handled by the
  program but an error message is printed to the log file.
