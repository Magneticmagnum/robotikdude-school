Described below are the different logging levels used and a description when
they are used.

TRACE:
Used when logging the FLOW of the program. Everything at the TRACE level should
deal with how the program flows. Method entrances and exits, loops, etc. 

DEBUG: (testing)
Used when printing runtime debug information. This can be anything from
printing variable values to a message when a special case happens. Any general
printing that is not required by the program and does not have to do with the
flow of the program should be at the DEBUG level.

INFO: (executable)
This is the default level for logging. Messages at the INFO level are
messages that are required by the program but do not fall into the ERROR
category and are not part of the debugging.

ERROR:
Used when an error occurs. Usually the error is properly handled by the
program but an error message is printed to the log file.
